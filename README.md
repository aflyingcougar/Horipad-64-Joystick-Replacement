## Purpose

The puropse of this project is to design a form-fit-function replacement for the analog joystick assembly in the Horipad Mini 64 controller for the Nintendo 64.

## Background

A few months ago, my Horipad Mini 64 (Horipad) fell off of my desk, and the fall damaged the joystick beyond repair. Given that a used replacement Horipad can cost anywhere from about $60 up to $100 USD, I decided I'd try my hand at addressing the real issue: nobody sells replacement parts for the Horipad.

## Definitions

## Design Goals

1. Design a replacement printed circuit board (PCB) that can be installed into any Horipad without physical modifications to the controller.
2. Identify and procure an analog stick that can be installed onto the PCB (1) and is physically compatible with the Horipad analog joystick cap.
3. The analog stick pcb assembly (1)(2) should produce a stick pattern that is as close to the "Perfect Hori Pattern" as possible.
